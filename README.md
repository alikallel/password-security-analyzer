---

##  Overview

A security tool built to check password strength, verify passwords against breach databases, and check email addresses for exposure in known data breaches. This tool uses custom checks to assess password complexity and integrity while suggesting stronger alternatives.

##  Features

### 🔐 Password Strength Checker
* **Length Check** - Ensures the password meets minimum length requirements
* **Character Type Validation** - Checks for uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters
* **Entropy Scoring** - Provides an entropy score to measure password strength
* **Common Patterns Detection** - Identifies easily guessable patterns like `12345`, `qwerty`

### 🌐 Wordlist Check
* **Wordlist Verification** - Checks if the password is found in known wordlists such as rockyou.txt
* **Leetspeak & Variations** - Detects common substitutions and variations

### 📧 Email Breach Check
* **HackCheck API Integration** - Verifies if an email address is part of known data breaches
* **Breach Information** - Provides details about any breaches found

### 🔑 Password Strength Suggestions
* **Improved Password Suggestions** - Suggests stronger passwords based on missing character types
* **Entropy Enhancements** - Increases password entropy by adding missing complexity
